I am currently a PhD candidate at the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, working under the supervision of Prof. Tobias Schlicht and Prof. Daniel Dennett.

The main topic of my research concerns the way in which conscious experience can be accommodated within predictive processing and whether the framework can yield a new perspective on the nature of consciousness. In my dissertation I investigate the explanatory status of the predictive processing framework, focusing specifically on the relationship between mental representations and the content of perceptual experiences.

Apart from predictive processing, mental representations, and consciousness, I am also keenly interested in issues prominent in philosophy of perception, situated cognition, enactivism, metacognition, and levels of explanation in cognitive science. Outside of philosophy, I spend a lot of time reading about computational modeling, probability theory, and cybersecurity.
