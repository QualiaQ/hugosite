title: "Who am I?"
---

I am currently a postdoc at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum and a member of Prof. Tobias Schlicht's research group realizing the Volkswagen Foundation grant entitled 'Situated Cognition: Perceiving the World and Other Minds'.

My doctoral research was also conducted at the Ruhr-Universität, where I was supervised by Prof. Schlicht and Prof. Daniel Dennett. In my dissertation I investigated the way in which the computational models developed within the framework of predictive processing constrain the space of possible mechanisms underlying perceptual experience and whether the framework can yield a new perspective on the nature of consciousness. I was awarded my PhD in Philosophy with a grade of summa cum laude in May 2019.

Apart from predictive processing, mental representations, and consciousness, I am also keenly interested in issues prominent in philosophy of perception, computation,  meta-cognition, situated cognition, and levels of explanation in cognitive science. Outside of philosophy, I spend a lot of time reading about computational modeling, probability theory, and digital rights.
