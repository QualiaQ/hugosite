title: "Who am I?"
---

I am currently a postdoc at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum and a member of [Prof. Tobias Schlicht's research group](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophy/bewusstsein/team.html.en) realizing the Volkswagen Foundation grant entitled 'Situated Cognition: Perceiving the World and Other Minds'.

My doctoral research was also conducted at the Ruhr-Universität, where I was supervised by [Prof. Schlicht](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/philosophy/bewusstsein/index.html.de) and [Prof. Daniel Dennett](https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/). In my dissertation I investigated the way in which the computational models developed within the framework of predictive processing constrain the space of possible mechanisms underlying perceptual experience and whether the framework can yield a new perspective on the nature of consciousness. I was awarded my PhD in Philosophy with a grade of summa cum laude in May 2019. My work was also distinguished by the GfD with [the annual prize for the best interdisciplinary dissertation](https://www.freunde-rub.de/nachrichten.html).

Apart from probabilistic models of cognition, mental representations, and consciousness, I am also keenly interested in topics prominent in philosophy of perception, computation,  meta-cognition, situated cognition, and philosophy of science. Outside of philosophy, I spend a lot of time reading about computational modeling, probability theory, and digital rights.
